<h1 class="header">Algorithms for Vehicle Routing Problem</h1>
<p>
  The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is one of the most studied optimisation problems of all time. It involves finding the best route for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods to customers.
  The VRP is a node routing problems since the service it provides is associated with nodes or locations. 
  It is the simplest type of node routing problem, in which a single vehicle visits several locations, with no limitations on the vehicle's capacity.
  In most cases, it is also assumed that the routes start and end at the same depot. 
  Vehicles serve several different customer locations, each of which, in
  certain variations, have distinct service requirements (pick up or delivery). It is also noteworthy
  that each route identified in the VRP is a Hamiltonian cycle. This is because on a particular
  route, each location is visited exactly once and the start and end of each route are at the same
  location, i.e., at the depot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There are 9 variations of the VRP that have been implemented for this application, and they are described in the table below.

    This is a variation of the VRP in
    which each vehicle's capacity for carrying goods is limited, and this limit should not be
    exceeded for any of the vehicles. It is also assumed that all vehicles are stationed at a
    single depot and that each route will begin and end at the depot. Additional constraints
    enforced are that each customer's location will be visited only once and that the total
    demand of a route will not exceed the capacity of the vehicle.

  <td>This is a slight variation of the Capacitated VRP in which new costs, called penalties are introduced at all locations. 
    Whenever a visit to a location is dropped, the penalty is added to the total distance travelled. 
    The algorithm finds a route that minimises the total distance plus the sum of the penalties for all dropped locations.

  <td>
    In the Open VRP, vehicles do not start or return to the depot after they have
    completed their journeys along their respective routes. Since the vehicles
    do not return to the starting depot, in the OVRP each route is a Hamiltonian path instead
    of a Hamiltonian cycle. This algorithm is useful in cases where organisations do not
    own a convoy of vehicles, or their convoy is insufficient and the organisation
    needs to outsource transport services.

    The aim is to identify routes for vehicles to
    complete both pickups and deliveries of items between specified locations. The pickup and
    delivery locations for a particular item are distinct. It is assumed that the vehicles start
    and end their routes at the same depot. In the case where people are being transported,
    the problem is also called the dial-a-ride problem.
    Theoretically in PDP, it is assumed that an unlimited number of vehicles will be available,
    and every customer will be delivered their items. However, this is not practical and
    therefore identifying optimal routes is important to maximise customer deliveries with a
    limited number of vehicles.

    In this problem, a set of initial routes is specified for the vehicles in the VRP. The algorithm is run to obtain the initial
    solution routes, after which the basic VRP algorithm is run. This is useful for cases where a good solution to the problem is 
    already known, and where comparing performance of different possible routes is required.

    In all problems except the Open VRP, it is assumed that all vehicles start and end at a single location, the depot. In this
    variation of the VRP, different start and end locations can be set for each vehicle. In many cases, the total distance of routes
    is shorter since the vehicles are not required to start or end at the depot.

    A service time window
    (TW) constraint is imposed on the VRP, in which the visiting time of a vehicle at a location
    is restricted according to the specified time period. This enforces that each customer must
    be served during the time period specified. If the vehicle reaches the customer destination
    before the start of its time window, the vehicle should wait until the specified service time
    begins. Similarly, the constraint is violated if the vehicle arrives after the time window has
    ended. It is assumed that all customers require the same type of service (either pickup or
    delivery but not both) and vehicles start and end their routes at the same depot. Another
    constraint that is strictly imposed is that the vehicle capacity should not be exceeded at
    any time.

    A variation of VRPTW that also has constraints at the depot: all vehicles need to be loaded before departing the depot and unloaded upon return. 
    Since there are only two available loading docks, at most two vehicles can be loaded or unloaded at the same time.
    As a result, some vehicles must wait for others to be loaded, delaying their departure from the depot. 
    The problem is to find optimal vehicle routes for the VRPTW that also meet the loading and unloading constraints at the depot.
